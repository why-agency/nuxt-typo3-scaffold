# Integrations

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains any third party plugins such as CMPs, Chat plugins, translators...

Creating a file in this directory automatically registers the integrations within the plugins directory.

Helper functions for loading plugins after page load can be added to the utils directory. For detailed information, [check this blog post](https://deltener.com/blog/nuxt-third-party-code-is-poison/).
